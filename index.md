## Hi there!
My name is Tang Kaiyang, and this is my first GitHub page. I'm currently a biology major in Tsinghua University, Beijing, China ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³

The majority of my lab experience falls in the field of cell biology, but I'm also interested what we can accomplish by applying computing techniques to bioinformation analysis.
