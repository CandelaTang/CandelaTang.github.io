## Hi there!
My name is K. Y. Tang, and this is my first GitHub page. I'm currently a biology major in Tsinghua University, Beijing, China ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³

The majority of my lab experience falls in the field of cell biology, but I'm also interested what we can accomplish by applying computing techniques to bioinformation analysis.

#### *what I have done* 
- Designed LAMP primers for oral pathogenic bacteria detection with Primer Explorer
- Analyzed SNP site sequencing data using FinchTV and ucsc database
- Designed square lattice DNA origami structure with cadnano
- Designed DNA regular tetrahedron structure with NanoEngineer
- Analyzed differentially expressed genes from TCGA data with R
- Analyzed gene expression correlation with R

#### *what I expect to learn*
- Basic commands in linux, R, and Python
- Logic in analyzing basic biological data
- A general idea on what bioinformatics can do and what it aims to achieve

Since I'm new to GitHub, I'm still figuring out my way around here. Have fun coding & have a nice day!  <br/>
